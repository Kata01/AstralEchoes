# Astral Echoes

##Short game made with Unity and based in the short story "Kaleidoscope" by Ray Bradbury.

-The game is in spanish.
-Control character with arrow keys, use w, s and enter to select dialogue. Dodge the meteorites to preserve your limbs. Try to mantain a normal BPM through dialogue options.
-Deaths by lost of two hands are still not implemented, as the death by heart attack (too many BPM). Different endings should be also implemented based on the BPM you have when you arrive to Earth's atmosphere.
-It needs an intro scene, that explains that the spaceship exploded and now all crew members are floating through space in different directions.
-It needs a minigame for the moment when a member of the crew suffers a panic attack.
- A kaleidoscope scene with a minigame should also be implemented.
