# Astral Echoes

##Short game based in the short story "Kaleidoscope" by Ray Bradbury.

Made with Unity.

Deaths by lost of two hands are still not implemented, as the death by heart attack (too many BPM). Different endings should be also implemented based on the BPM you have when you arrive to Earth's atmosphere.
